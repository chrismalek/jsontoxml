h1. JSON to XML

This is a simple go web application that uses https://github.com/clbanning/mxj package to convert JSON to XML and visa versa.

I created this because I was working with some web services in PeopleSoft and the JSON support was terrible. Peoplesoft could generate valid JSON but it was having problems parsing.  I figured I could get the JSON from the web service. Then invoke this service to get XML back which could then more easily be parsed by PeoplelSoft.

* If you send in an array it fails.  For example
<pre>
[{"somekey":"somevalue"},
{"somekey":"somevalue"},
{"somekey":"somevalue"}]
</pre>
