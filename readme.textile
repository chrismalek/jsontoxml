h1. JSON to XML

This is a simple go web application that uses @github.com/clbanning/mxj@ and @github.com/clbanning/anyxml@ package to convert JSON to XML and visa versa.

I created this because I was working with some web services in PeopleSoft and the JSON support was terrible. Peoplesoft could generate valid JSON but it was having problems parsing.  I figured I could get the JSON from the web service. Then invoke this service to get XML back which could then more easily be parsed by PeoplelSoft.

Special thanks to @clbanning for both of his libraries and help.
